## Description
This README Generator is a tool designed to assist developers in quickly creating professional README files for their projects. It automates the process of generating the necessary sections and provides prompts to help users populate them effectively.

- Motivation: As a developer, I often find myself spending valuable time crafting README files for my projects. This tool was created to streamline this process, allowing me to focus more on coding and less on documentation.
- Problem it solves: Manually creating README files can be time-consuming and repetitive. This generator simplifies the task by providing a template and guiding users through the necessary sections.
- What I learned: While building this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Markdown syntax and the importance of clear project documentation.
